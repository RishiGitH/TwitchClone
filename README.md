# MaxPipes_App

"*In short this project is my attempt at a clone of the Twitch Tv android app.*"

This is a personal project of mine which I am trying to fill two requirements.
Firstly its my first fully fledged android app (Or attempt), so there is alot of learning, and secondly it is another project
in which I can use the Twitch api again, and muck around with streaming video etc.

This is a work in progress.

####Current State:

- Can display the top 10 current live streamed games from twitch.tv
- Can display the top 10 current live channels of a selected game
- Shows the number of views, live channels, and the game name in the Game Tile.
- Shows the number of views, and the channel name in the Stream Tile.
- Used picasso library to cache required images.
- Have fully coded the .m3u8 playlist compatability.
- Is able to load and play/pause live twitch tv streams in default android media-player.

####Planned:

- Add back button compatibility, and handle closing/backing out of player.
- Customize the player controls. *(Remove the seek-bar, time, forward/rewind buttons)*
- Allow for MAX and MIN screen buttons on the media player controls.
- Allow for changing of the streamed resolution.
